Personal projects to get me better with C++

PLEASE NOTE: For those who (like me) don't know how to access C++ files in VSCode, use Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 (This is what I use), then, to navigate, input cd, followed by the directory location of your project (ex: cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyProject), last, input "code ." to load up the project.
